## 🔄 Process Overview

The Emotion-Based Music Recommender follows a unique process to enhance your music listening experience:

1. **Facial Emotion Recognition**: An image is analyzed to detect the user's current emotional state.
2. **Text Generation**: Based on the detected emotion, personalized text is generated to accompany the music recommendation.
3. **Music Video Suggestion**: Finally, the system suggests a music video that aligns with the detected emotion, completing an immersive user experience.

From the initial image processing to the final music suggestion, every step is carefully crafted to ensure seamless and intuitive user interaction.
